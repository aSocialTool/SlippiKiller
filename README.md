# SlippiKiller
A little program in Python to Kill Slippi Dolphin.

**NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS WINDOWS ONLY.**

I bullied ChatGPT to make this program because if you try to leave full-screen, the game will more often than not gray-screen and you have to use CMD to kill it.
This program, once you install it. It starts on Startup and if you press Numpad8, it will run "taskkill /f /im "slippi dolphin.exe"
Thx!
